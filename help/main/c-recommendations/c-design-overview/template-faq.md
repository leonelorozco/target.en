# ![PREMIUM](/help/main/assets/premium.png) Design FAQ 

List of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about [!DNL Adobe Target] [!DNL Recommendations] designs.

## My recommended item's price isn't displaying both values to the right of the decimal point. How can I display them?

By default, numeric values (such as `entity.value`) returned in design templates won't display any trailing zeroes after the decimal point. For example, if an item is $35.00, `entity.value` is equal to 35 and only 35 is displayed on the page, not $35.00. 

Two options are available to address this issue: 

* You can use Velocity scripting or Javascript to apply formatting to the returned value.

* You can pass the price of the item into two separate entity attributes. The first, `entity.value`, can be used for numeric comparisons (such as price comparison rules). The second should be a custom attribute, such as `entity.displayValue` that stores the value of the entity as a string to allow for proper rendering.

  For example,

  `"entity.value" : 35.00, "entity.displayValue" : "$35.00"`

## Why isn't category showing in the design? I'm using `$entity1.categoryId`. {#section_073309B8051049C7953D396A93EA0713}

Category ID can't be displayed in the design. Because multiple categories can be stored, the system wouldn't know which category to display.

## How should I change a design to get an instant update? {#section_28EE35A5B10B47ECA4A332F0E5B2598F}

Altering the design that is currently in use takes a while to update. To change the design instantly, create a new design, select it in the activity, and save the recommendation.

## How can I capture key information for display in the design? Example: If we want to display the key product's category, how would I code that value in the velocity design? {#section_F08043B14BA24BC8815FEF25F4F84C39}

The `$key. *`value`*` parameter captures most of the key product's information to display within the design. Example: If you want to display the key product's thumbnail, you would use `$key.thumbnailURL`.

## Which version of Velocity is used? {#section_28F00E15A4A54A768782A3F5BB0CDB21}

Version 1.7 with no additional tools or libraries added in. Basic Velocity functionality is available.

## How do I replace an existing entity value with a blank? For example, an item's entity.message needs to be cleared when a promotion ends. {#section_B88F2C2925DC4508974B2F8B13F961CB}

Sending in a JavaScript non-breaking space seems to do this. Have the developers send in `\u00A0` as the value. Example: `entity.message=\u00A0`. You might consider having that be the default value when no value is present instead of a null.

## Can I use a profile script in a [!DNL Recommendations] design? {#section_6BD55203984A4D80A0C6F241AD7806DF}

Yes. To use a profile script in a [!DNL Recommendations] design, wrap the name in `\${...}`. For example, if your profile script is named `user.basket`, refer it as `\${user.basket}` in the design. Note that the backslash implies that the profile script is not rendered by Velocity. Therefore, you cannot perform any operations on the profile script in a Velocity template. The value will be directly printed on the page.
